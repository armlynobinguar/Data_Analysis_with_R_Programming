# Data_Analysis_with_R_Programming

R is a popular programming language for data science and data analysis. It is also known for straightforward data visualization and statistical computing. In the rapidly growing data science field, top tech firms employ multiple R programmers, where they enjoy high average salaries. In this lesson, we'll cover what you need to know to get started programming in R.

There are several reasons why R is such a popular and useful programming language. One reason is due to the fact that online R community is one of the friendliest and most supportive. Another reason is because RStudio Cloud allows you to program in R directly from your web browser, and, generally speaking, R simplifies everyday data science tasks. Let's see how.

Here are a few topics we will cover in this lesson:

The basics of R syntax
Introduction to data types in R
How to perform calculations using comparison operators
By the end of this course, we'll know how to do the following:

Load a dataset into R that contains salary information about data science jobs
Explore and describe the dataset
Generate the following plot to visualize data science salaries by job type
